## Key Findings

1. **Top 3 UX Issues**:

    - **Performance Issue (14,861 occurrences, 86% Negative)**: The most frequent complaint, indicating significant issues with application speed, responsiveness, or stability.
    - **Connectivity Issue (11,021 occurrences, 79.8% Negative)**: A major issue likely related to network, server, or external service integration problems.
    - **Technical Issue (8,031 occurrences, 82.9% Negative)**: General technical problems, possibly including bugs or system errors.

2. **Other UX Issue (7,637 occurrences)**:

    - This category is heterogeneous, with a more balanced sentiment distribution (61.4% Negative, 16.3% Neutral, 22.3% Positive). It likely includes minor UI/UX issues, feature requests, or miscellaneous feedback.
    - Further analysis is needed to break down specific themes within this category.

3. **Positive Feedback (7,386 occurrences)**:
    - Predominantly positive (90.7% Positive), indicating areas where users are satisfied. These aspects should be maintained or enhanced.

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Performance Improvements**:
    - Focus on optimizing application speed, reducing crashes, and improving responsiveness to address the high volume of negative feedback in Performance Issues.
2. **Investigate Connectivity Issues**:
    - Review server infrastructure, API reliability, and network dependencies to mitigate connectivity-related complaints.
3. **Refine Technical Issues**:
    - Conduct root cause analysis for technical bugs and implement fixes to reduce the 8,031 reported issues.
4. **Break Down "Other UX Issue"**:
    - Perform qualitative analysis (e.g., text mining of user comments) to identify specific pain points or feature requests within this category.
5. **Leverage Positive Feedback**:
    - Identify and reinforce aspects of the application that receive positive feedback to maintain user satisfaction.
6. **Monitor and Validate Data**:
    - Ensure data integrity by checking for duplicates or biases in user feedback (e.g., multiple entries from "Pengguna Google").

## Next Steps

-   Conduct deeper analysis of the "Other UX Issue" category to uncover specific themes or recurring issues.
-   Implement targeted fixes for Performance and Connectivity Issues and monitor their impact on user sentiment.
-   Consider visualizing the data (e.g., bar charts for issue counts or pie charts for sentiment distribution) for stakeholder presentations.

## Notes

-   The dataset appears consistent and reliable, with sentiment distributions aligning with expectations for UX feedback.
-   The high volume of negative sentiment in Performance, Connectivity, and Technical Issues indicates critical areas for improvement.
